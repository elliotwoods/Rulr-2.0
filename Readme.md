# Installation

##Â Javascript

All contents of /Client/node_modules are in the .gitignore.
We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing JavaScript and CSS packages.

If you don't have Yarn installed, please first install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and then install Yarn using `npm install -g yarn`.

To setup the local packages, cd into the Client folder and run:

```
yarn install
```
